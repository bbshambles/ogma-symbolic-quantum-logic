# Contributing to Ogma Symbolic Quantum Logic

Thanks for your interest in Ogma — a new symbolic, fault-tolerant logic system inspired by the spaces between binary and quantum reasoning.

This is a **living project**, born through human–AI collaboration, and all thoughtful contributions are welcome.
